# A very fast bitmap implementation of the dynamic wheel sieve of Pritchard

This repository concerns the dynamic wheel sieve of Pritchard as described on its [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Pritchard).
It is an algorithm for finding the primes up to a given limit N that takes sublinear time O(N/log log N).
The repository gives a very fast implementation of the algorithm using a bitmap, aiming to minimize the execution time for N around 10^9.

The original implementation is described in the paper
[Paul Pritchard, "A Sublinear Additive Sieve for Finding Prime Numbers", *Communications of the ACM*, vol. 24, no. 1, pp. 18â€“23](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/358527.358540).
A detailed code animation with a limit of N=150 is given in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxgGMwLfTjE).

Since the dynamic wheel sieve was presented as a contribution to computational complexity (and as a beautiful algorithm),
the original implementation was designed to demonstrate the sublinear running time as simply and clearly as possible.
Nevertheless, it is interesting to ask just how fast (or not) this algorithm can be.

## The approach taken

The common approach to optimizing the sieve of Eratosthenes involves using a bitmap, i.e.,
a sequence of bits representing the sifted status of successive prime candidates:
0 for known to be composite (i.e., sifted by a prime already considered),
and 1 for possibly prime (not sifted by the primes already considered).
The simplest way is to use 1 bit for each number up to the limit N.
Using 1 bit for each odd number is a common improvement, equivalent to using wheel 1 rolled up to N.
We use a compression scheme that exploits the fact that wheel 3 (for primes 2,3,5) has 8 members, which fit nicely in one byte.
See [this explanation](http://tverniquet.com/hprime/#p1:i2).

The only other important technique used is the intrinsic *__builtin_ctzll* in the g++ compiler,
which enables iterating over set bits quickly (especially on modern x64 processors).
See [here](https://lemire.me/blog/2018/03/08/iterating-over-set-bits-quickly-simd-edition/) for a discussion which also presents
an alternative SIMD approach (i.e., operating on short vectors).
The intrinsic *__builtin_popcountll* is also for the final counting of set bits.

The code is essentially a straightforward implementation of the abstract set-theoretic algorithm.

### wheel_sieve_bitmap.cpp

This is a self-contained C++ program.
It essentially implements the abstract algorithm,
differing only in starting with wheel 3 (and therefore taking special action for N \< 30).

Note that the fully abstract algorithm (i.e. at the level of sets) does not need to specify how all the mutiples p\*f
of the current prime p are to be removed.
The code exploits this freedom by distinguishing between those multiples p\*f that occur as a factor f'=p\*f in another multiple p\*f',
and those that do not.
The former are stacked and removed later in decreasing order; the latter are safely removed immediately. 

Provided *__builtin_ctzll* finds each successive set bit in O(1) time (which is the case on modern processors),
the resulting program runs in O(N/log log N) time, and the implicit constant factor is very small.
It should be competitive with other single-threaded non-segmented prime number sieves.
